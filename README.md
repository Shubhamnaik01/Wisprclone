# 🎙️ Tauri Live Speech-to-Text App (Deepgram)

A cross-platform **desktop speech-to-text application** built using **Tauri + React** with a **Rust backend** and **Deepgram WebSocket API** for real-time transcription.

This project demonstrates **live audio capture**, **streaming transcription**, and **frontend–backend communication** using Tauri commands and events.

- 🎧 Live microphone recording
- 🧠 Real-time speech-to-text using
- ✍️ Interim + final transcript handling
- 📋 Copy transcript to clipboard
- 🖥️ Desktop app powered by Tauri (Rust + WebView)

## 🔐 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file inside `src-tauri/`:

```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key_here
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

From the project root:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2️⃣ Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Tauri application

From the project root:

```bash
cargo tauri dev
```

This will:

- Start the React frontend
- Launch the Tauri desktop window

## 🎙️ How It Works

1. User clicks the **mic button**
2. Browser captures microphone audio
3. Audio is converted to **16-bit PCM (48kHz)**
4. Chunks are streamed to Rust via Tauri `invoke`
5. Rust forwards audio to **Deepgram WebSocket**
6. Transcription results are emitted back to React
7. UI displays **final** and **interim** text separately

---

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

- **`useRef` instead of globals** for recorder lifecycle stability
- **WebSocket streaming** for low-latency transcription
- **Event-based communication** from Rust → React
- Clean separation of **interim vs final** transcripts
